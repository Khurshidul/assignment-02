                            Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged along
                            when his two older brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger
                            boys. At the age of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys, a
                            Rosario-based club.
